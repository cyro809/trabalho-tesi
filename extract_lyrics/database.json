Eminem &amp; Kanye West)\n\n(Hook)\nMonsters, how should I feel?\nCreatures lie here, looking through the window (2x)\n\n(Verse 1: TI)\nFrom the king of the south to the king of the states\nRiding in a car you've probably never seen in the states\nNo idea how much yay I can bring in the states\nHey you got a hundred on 'em for a million a day\nFrank Lucas ain't the only one to make a million a day\nBut it's a American gangsta right here in your face\nAnd you don't want to see P$C on the scene with a K\nYou think you running up and robbing but that ain't even the case\nAnd just because you got away don't mean it's okay\nYou a dead man walking and I mean it, okay?\nGonna take that other couple mil' and put it back in the safe\nFive cash for the crib on the back of the lake\nI'm up in crucial two-stepping with the GAT in the waist\nTI ain't in the street no mo', fo'-fo', is that what they say?\nDon't even try when you see him boy you have to be great\nCause this pistol hit you in your face, you'll teeth they'll have to replace\n\n(Hook)\nMonsters, how should I feel?\nCreatures lie here, looking through the window (2x)\n\n(Verse 2: Kanye West)\nThey say your attitide determines your latitude\nI'm high as a motherfucker, fly as a motherfucker\nAnd still the motherfucker you love to hate\nBut can't - because you love what I make\nNow ain't that about a bitch\nI'mma talk shit until I'm out of hits\nThey don't wanna turn they sneakers up they claim I ain't deep enough\nAll that talking I keep off of, keep it up\nI'm relaxin', my feet is up\nI'm leaving you haters like when Shaq left the Lakers just to Heat it up\nI state the stats to stunt, I don't need to front\nThere black history every day, I don't need a month\nThe survey says - by the streets accordin'\nKanye's just as important as Michael Jordan\nWas to the NBA when he was scorin'\nRalph Lauren was borin' before I wore him and...\n\n(Hook)\nMonsters, how should I feel?\nCreatures lie here, looking through the window (2x)\n\n(Verse 3: Eminem)\nSchizophrenia, how many of ya got it?\nHow many motherfuckers can say they psychotic?\nHow many motherfuckers can say they brain dry-rotted from pot?\nYou got it like I got it or not?\nIf you did, you would know just what I'm talkin bout\nWhen your tongue's rottin out from cotton-mouth\nWhen you end up becomin so dependent on weed\nThat you end up spendin a \"G\" in the vending machine\nYou got the munchies, look at you, junk food junkie\nPotato chips and lunch meat, up in the front seat\nSometimes you can get so paranoid from ganja\nThat's it gotcha thinkin the whole world is watchin ya\nOr maybe you don't smoke, maybe you just roll\nBut whatever your drug's yo, go for the gusto\nJust don't, come fuck with me when I'm doin my drugs\nYou see me in the club don't come fuckin my high up\n\n(Hook)\nMosters, how should I feel?\nCreatures lie here, looking through the window (2x)\n\n\nBY: Suredo",

(Thing!)\nThat thing, that thing, that thing! (Thing!)\n\nThrow your hands in the air!\nAdmit two shots in the atmosphere!\n\n[Verse One - Lauryn]\n\nIt's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend\nThe one you let hit it and never called you again\nRemember when he told you he was about the benjamins?\nYou act like you ain't hear him, and gave him a little trim\nTo begin, how you think you're really going to pretend\nLike you wasn't down and you called him again?\nPlus when, you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him\nIf you did it then, then you'd probably fuck again\nTalking out your neck, saying you're a Christian\nA Muslim, sleeping with the Gin\nNow that was the sin that did Jezebel in\nWho're you going to tell when the repercussions spin?\nShowing off your ass 'cause your thinking it's a trend\nGirlfriend, let me break it down for you again!\nYou know I only say it 'cause i'm truly genuine\nDon't be a hard rock, when you really are a gem\nBaby girl! Respect is just a minimum\nNigga's fucked up and you still defending him\nNow -- Lauryn is only human\nDon't think I haven't been through the same predicament\nLet it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly Penn\nIt's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in\nLook at what you be in, hair weaves like Europeans\nFake nails done by Koreans\n\nCome again\nYo! A-When when come again! (Yeah-Yeah!)\nWhen when come again!! (Yeah-Yeah!)\nMy friend come again!!! (Yeah-Yeah!)\n\n[Chorus - Lauryn]\n\nGuys you know you'd better, watch out (Watch out!)\nSome girls, some girls are only, about (About!)\nThat thing, that thing, that thing! (Thing!)\nThat thing, that thing, that thing! (Thing!)\n\n[Verse Two - Lauryn]\n\nThe second verse is dedicated to the men\nMore concerned with his rims and his Tim's than his women\nHim and his men, come in the club like hooligans\nDon't care who they offend\nPopping yin (Like you got yang!)\nLet's stop pretend, the ones that pack pistols by the waist men\nCristall by the case men, still living in his Mother's basement\nThe pretty face men claiming that they be the \"big men.\"\nNeed to take care of their three and four kids\nBut they face a court case when the child support's late\nMoney taking and heart breaking\nNow you wonder why women hate men\nThe sneaky silent men\nThe punk domestic violence men\nQuick to shoot the semen, stop acting like boys and be men!\nHow you gonna win, when you ain't right within?!\nHow you gonna win, when you ain't right within?!\nHow you gonna win, when you ain't right within?!\nUnh-Unhh Come Again!\nbredrin come again!\nSit straight come again!\n\nWatch out, watch out\nLook out, look out\nWatch out, watch out\nLook out, look out\nWatch out, watch out\nLook out, look out\nWatch out, watch out\nLook out, look out\n\n[Lauryn - Singing Chorus]\n\nGirls you know you'd better, watch out (Watch out!)\nSome guys, some guys are only about (About!)\nThat thing, that thing, that thing! (Thing!)\nThat thing, that thing, that thing! (Thing!)\n\nGuys you know you'd better, watch out (Watch out!)\nSome girls, some girls are only, about (About!)\nThat thing, that thing, that thing!

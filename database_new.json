        "lyrics": "Standing on the waters casting your bread\nWhile the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing.\nDistant ships sailing into the mist,\nYou were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing. \nFreedom just around the corner for you\nBut with the truth so far off, what good will it do?\n\nJokerman dance to the nightingale tune,\nBird fly high by the light of the moon,\nOh, oh, oh, Jokerman.\n\nSo swiftly the sun sets in the sky,\nYou rise up and say goodbye to no one.\nFools rush in where angels fear to tread,\nBoth of their futures, so full of dread, you don't show one.\nShedding off one more layer of skin,\nKeeping one step ahead of the persecutor within.\n\nJokerman dance to the nightingale tune,\nBird fly high by the light of the moon,\nOh, oh, oh, Jokerman.\n\nYou're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,\nManipulator of crowds, you're a dream twister.\nYou're going to Sodom and Gomorrah\nBut what do you care? Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister.\nFriend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,\nYou look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name.\n\nJokerman dance to the nightingale tune,\nBird fly high by the light of the moon,\nOh, oh, oh, Jokerman.\n\nWell, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,\nThe law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers.\nIn the smoke of the twilight on a milk-white steed,\nMichelangelo indeed could've carved out your features.\nResting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,\nHalf asleep near the stars with a small dog licking your face.\n\nJokerman dance to the nightingale tune,\nBird fly high by the light of the moon,\nOh. oh. oh. Jokerman.\n\nWell, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,\nPreacherman seeks the same, who'll get there first is uncertain.\nNightsticks and water cannons, tear gas, padlocks,\nMolotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain,\nFalse-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,\nOnly a matter of time 'til night comes steppin' in.\n\nJokerman dance to the nightingale tune,\nBird fly high by the light of the moon,\nOh, oh, oh, Jokerman.\n\nIt's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,\nA woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet.\nHe'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,\nTake the motherless children off the street\nAnd place them at the feet of a harlot.\nOh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,\nOh, Jokerman, you don't show any response.\n\nJokerman dance to the nightingale tune,\nBird fly high by the light of the moon,\nOh, oh, oh, Jokerman.",

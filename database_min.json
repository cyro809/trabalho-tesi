Respect is just a minimum\nNigga's fucked up and you still defending him\nNow -- Lauryn is only human\nDon't think I haven't been through the same predicament\nLet it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly Penn\nIt's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in\nLook at what you be in, hair weaves like Europeans\nFake nails done by Koreans\n\nCome again\nYo! A-When when come again! (Yeah-Yeah!)\nWhen when come again!! (Yeah-Yeah!)\nMy friend come again!!!
